Design Changes (From 'to-do'  to 'food ordering' system):

1. Food ordering system will pre-populate the list of orders with price to client.
2. Once order selected, system will enlist the choice to client with remove option.
3. System will display count of orders and running total price (inclusive of 7.5% tax)
of all selected food items.

I was planning to create menu collection and seed it with food order list but
due to time limitation, I follow below approach
The system has menu JSON embedded into server module which act as on-a-fly reference collection.
On selection order by client, server checks entry and corresponding price and push to DB.

Count and Total Price of orders is calculated at each event of API call.
